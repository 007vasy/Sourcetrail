// 7 - THAT'S IT
//  You completed the tutorial on the graph view. There is still more to learn
//  but I guess you will figure it out on your own. One last thing: If you see
//  an element with a hatched background please call us. It's a runaway!
//  Just kidding. Those are elements that are used within your code, but have no
//  definition anywhere in your source folder (like the "int" symbol on the 
//  right hand side of the graph). So if you click them, Coati will display
//  all the relations for the element, but the code view won't show a 
//	definition. If you want to learn more about Coati, go back to the central
//  hub. It is called in the function below but you can also try to get there
//  using only the graph.
