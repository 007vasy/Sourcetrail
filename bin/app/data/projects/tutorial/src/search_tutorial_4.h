//
// 4 - WHAT ARE THE OTHER BUTTONS?
//  Well done. Lets get over the other buttons left to the search bar really
//  quick.
//
// 5 - UNDO AND REDO
//  You can use the buttons to the very left to undo and redo your actions. This
//  may seem odd since Coati doesn't include any features to actually change
//  code. Instead Coati offers these buttons to help you navigate. So they
//  really come in handy in case you ask yourself something like "How did I end
//  up here?"
//
// 6 - REFRESH
//  The next button allows you to refresh you project in case you changed some
//  of your code. The second button toggels the auto-refresh option. When
//  enabled Coati refreshes your project every time it's window gets focused.
//
// 7 - WHAT'S NEXT?
//  Instead of the class activate the struct with the same name as before.
