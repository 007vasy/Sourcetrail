// WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
//  As I mentioned earlier, Coati knows the concept of an "active" symbol. You 
//  just changed the active symbol by clicking on the name of a function. 
//
// OK, BUT WHAT IS AN ACTIVE SYMBOL?
//  Coati doesn't show your entire code base on a single screen. Even for 
//  relatively small projects that would be pointless - trust me on that. So 
//  instead of showing everything at once, Coati keeps a strongly focused view 
//  on your code. This focus only includes the currently active symbol and its 
//  direct relations. Nothing more. By changing the active symbol as you just 
//  did, Coati allows you to jump through the code base on your own.
//
// I THINK I GOT IT!
//  Now that you understand Coati's central concept you are ready to jump 
//  further by activating "the_central_hub()" of this tutorial.
