These Edge Cases should be considered in a dedicated Test Solution for the Plugin

-Non C/C++ Projects
	-include projects that are not C/C++ based
	-those should be ignored by the plugin
		-not show up in the project list when creating a CDB
		-not show up in the resulting CDB

-Solution Folders
	-the solution should include Solution Folders with Projects inside
	-at least two levels deep
	
-Include Paths
	-add at least one include path to Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->VC++ Directories->Include Directories
	
-Solution Structure
	-have a solution with no projects directly under the solution
		-so: Solution/Folder/Project
		-no: Solution/Project
